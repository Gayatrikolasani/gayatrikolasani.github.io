          <p>
            I recently graduated in Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial
            Intelligence) and enjoy working at the intersection of data,
            algorithms, and real-world outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            My major project was an
            <strong>AI-powered career pathway guidance system</strong> that delivers
            personalized career suggestions, skill-gap analysis, and course
            recommendations to students. I designed the data preprocessing
            pipeline, applied ML models, and evaluated system performance using
            metrics such as accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also participated in  robotics hackathon where I
            co-developed an <strong>autonomous shopping trolley</strong> using ROS
            and Python, improving navigation performance and reducing execution
            errors through simulation and optimization.

              I am actively looking for entry-level opportunities where I can
              work with data, analytics, and decision-making.

            I enjoy breaking down ambiguous problems into smaller, structured
            steps—from cleaning messy datasets to selecting the right evaluation
            metrics. I like to validate decisions with data, but also think about
            how solutions feel for the end user.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Structured thinker</strong> – I’m comfortable moving from
              problem statement → hypotheses → data → insights → actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaborative</strong> – I’ve worked in teams for both
              academic projects and hackathons, coordinating roles and deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growth mindset</strong> – I actively learn new tools and
              concepts in ML, analytics, and visualization to improve my work.
